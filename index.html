    <h2 class="heading">Front-End</h2>
    <p>A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications.

        The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works.
        
        You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.
        
        The basic languages for Front-End Development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<h2 class="heading">Back-End</h2>
<p>Backend development focuses on a site's structure, data, system, and logic. 

  Whereas frontend development deals with the visual aspects of a website, i.e.,

the part that users see and interact with. If these go hand in hand, visually pleasing websites can be created.</p>

    <p>Web application is a piece of software that can be accessed by the browser. A Browser is an application that is used to browse the internet.
